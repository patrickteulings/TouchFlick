# TouchFlick

A basic responsive, touch-enabled and swipable gallery...

The gallery uses css transforms for positioning and RequestAnimationFrame combined with @robpenners easing equations for smooth swiping and easing. 

This a very straightforward implementation, not a plugin, allowing you to see and alter (or improve) any code you want).

Currently does not support multiple carousels on the same page or carousel-deletion, so handle with care!
